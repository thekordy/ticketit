## Installation
**First Make sure you have got all dependents working:**

1. [Laravel 5.1](http://laravel.com/docs/5.1#installation)
2. [Users table](http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/authentication)
3. [LaravelCollective HTML](http://laravelcollective.com/docs/5.1/html#installation)
4. [Laravel email configuration](http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/mail#sending-mail)

**To install this package:**

Run this code via your terminal
```shell
	composer require kordy/ticketit
```

After install it, you have to add this line on your `config/app.php` on Service Providers lines.
```php
	Kordy\Ticketit\TicketitServiceProvider::class,
```

Install database tables by running the migrate artisan command 
```php
	php artisan migrate --path=vendor/kordy/ticketit/src/Migrations
```

## Configuration
**You may publish all files at once**

```shell
	php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Kordy\Ticketit\TicketitServiceProvider"
```

**Or you may publish by tags**

Publish the config file (It will generate new file at `config/ticketit.php`. Edit necessary lines.)
```shell
	php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Kordy\Ticketit\TicketitServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```
Publish the views (It will generate views files at `resources/views/vendor/kordy/ticketit/`. Edit necessary lines.)
```shell
	php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Kordy\Ticketit\TicketitServiceProvider" --tag="views"
```

**After publishing the config file config/ticketit.php , edit it for your settings.**

**Be sure to implement these views sections in your master template in order to integrate with the ticketit views:**

Page section for passing the current page title
```blade
<header> ...
<title>My website - @yield('page')</title>
</header>
```
Content section for the content
```blade
<body> ...
@yield('content')
...
</body>
```

Footer section for passing the jquery scripts, so make sure it is called after you call the jquery
```blade
<body> ...
@yield('content')
...
<script src="/js/jquery.min.js"></script>
..
@yield('footer')
</body>
```
